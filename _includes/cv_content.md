Recipient of the DAAD Graduate School Scholarship – Germany (2023–2026)

🔭 I’m currently working on applied research at the intersection of migration, education, and child rights, with a regional focus on Southeast Asia. My current work spans exploratory field research, qualitative analysis, and policy-oriented studies for international organisations, including UNICEF and other development actors. I am also advancing doctoral research on the capabilities and lived experiences of conflict-displaced youth from Myanmar living in Thailand.

Recently, I co-founded the **[Centre for HDP Nexus Solutions](https://hdpnexus.org)**, and serve as a Co-Director. We seek to strengthen the humanitarian–development–peace nexus through context-driven research, practical guidance, and partnerships that support more coherent, locally grounded responses in crisis-affected settings.


👯 I’m looking to collaborate on research and consultancy projects that address displacement, education systems, youth development, and rights-based programming. I’m particularly interested in partnerships with NGOs, UN agencies, and research institutes that value rigorous qualitative methods, participatory approaches, and evidence synthesis to inform policy and programmatic decision-making.
